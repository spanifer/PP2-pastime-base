# Strategy

-   ## Definition
    - A simple visually appealing site about one single blackjack game or multiple easy to implement games like memory flip card game, or more advanced like a platformer, like dino-run and such
    - Demographic is for all who are willing to pastime
    - Blackjack as minimum viable product with html,css,js, and a `not fully realized` canvas based "game"

-   ## Value
    - For a user to take a break and relax throughout a hard day, have an engaging but not frustrating short experience of interactive games.
    - Interactive elements and animation is the main appeal

# Main Idea
## Website
- each game should have its own high score board if applicable, saved on local storage, with whatever username and date
- main page have the games listed in cards view horizontally (scrollable? pan-able) with a "more coming soon" card. (There will be always more coming soon)
- single page in full screen view, should have 0 scrolling behavior, but with a sandwich button that would pause the game and give a native experience like feature, bringing up the footer and down the header and other menu elements
    - should have option to (in a sense) quit the game and go back to the main menu
    - should have option to report error (that would be a text to describe the error, and further down the line to have error handling and logging that can be sent to the dev)
    - see the high scores or/and other game info that is not relevant on the main game but informative about the current game

- the site can have an about page but i already know i'll struggle to write any meaningful content in there. 
    - Maybe I can keep it concise and positioned in an appealing way to achieve the same user experience as a meaningful read would üòë
    - Or the about page could contain frequently asked questions (arising from testing) (although that is not about).

- the site can have a get in contact page, or report error
    - Or the contact page could contain frequently asked questions ...
